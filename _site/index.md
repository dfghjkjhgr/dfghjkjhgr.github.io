This is my website/webdev playground.
The product I am most proud of is my Rock Paper Scissors bot.
It's quite simple, and I like it a lot. I am currently working on a
tab management browser extension, among other things.
Some of my projects:

- [Add Only Calculator](https://add-only-calculator.randomletters.repl.co/)
